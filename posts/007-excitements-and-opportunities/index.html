        <p>Things that excite me:</p>
<ul>
<li>AI</li>
<li>Energy (fusion, renewables)</li>
<li>Transportation (rockets, Starship, etc.)</li>
<li>Biotech &amp; genetics</li>
<li>Financial market innovation -&gt; potentially crypto-related, think DeFi</li>
<li>Society-wide incentive system for behavioral change (e.g. encouraging having more kids) -&gt; potentially crypto-related, think StepN</li>
<li>Neurotech</li>

<p>What do people spend money for? How will they be changed by technological paradigm shifts, aka. opportunities?</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing 住: ?? (seems infra-dependent)</li>
<li>Food 食: 10x from biotech and energy</li>
<li>Transportation 行: 10x from energy</li>
<li>Clothing &amp; embellishments 衣: stable</li>
<li>Education: 10x from AI, stable with human service</li>
<li>Health: 10x from biotech, stable with human service</li>
<li>Brain I/O (phone, computer, etc.): stagnant, until 10x from neurotech</li>
<li>Entertainment (games, movies, music, etc.): stable and growing with human service</li>
<li>Love and belonging, self-esteem, self-actualization (from Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs): stable and growing with human service</li>
<li>(Upcoming) Space travel &amp; colonization: uniquely enabled by energy and transportation</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S.: &ldquo;衣食住行&rdquo; is a Chinese phrase that means &ldquo;clothing, food, housing, and transportation&rdquo;, which are the four basic necessities of life.</p>
<p>P.P.S.: &ldquo;10x&rdquo; is obviously not exact, just me saying tremendous disruption and improvement.</p>
