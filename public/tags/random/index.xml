      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what books are most suitable for audiobooks.
First, a bit of context for why audiobooks. A few steps of logical deduction:
There are times during the day at which my limbs are occupied but my brain isn&amp;rsquo;t.

However, they are deprecating rapidly in the face of enormous societal transformations, either hardly iterating or disproportionately benefiting the few. Incentive misalignment has once again become a serious hamper on productivity.</description>
