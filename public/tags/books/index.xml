      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what books are most suitable for audiobooks.
First, a bit of context for why audiobooks. A few steps of logical deduction:
There are times during the day at which my limbs are occupied but my brain isn&amp;rsquo;t. Examples are while driving, working out, boiling noodles, etc. My time is precious and I&amp;rsquo;d like to spend it on effective output or input. At most times above, output is difficult, so information input makes more sense.</description>
