Staying opimimistic â€” optimism is as much a choice as it is a disposition.

<!-- Some examples of things I care about:

- **Closing the loop for blockchain tech.** Crypto/web3 needs primitives which deliver consumer-level utility to close the value loop. I see gaming/content, identity, and special-purpose DeFi being strong contenders, with UGC platforms being a favorite.
- **Neuroscience.** The human brain is my biggest source of fascination, the ultimate scaling factor of civilization. I previously did DBS research at [Gallant Lab](https://gallantlab.org/). I see myself as a pupil of the brain over the years to come.
- **US-China.** Cooperation between the two superpowers on issues such as the climate is mission-critical to humanity's existence. I'm concerned about the lack of it. -->
