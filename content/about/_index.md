## **Yijia Chen**

I'm an engineer, entrepreneur, optimist. I'm currently building [Curio](https://www.curio.gg/), a blockchain gaming startup, and living in SF. I'm born and raised in China and previously attended UC Berkeley.

A few things I care about:

- **Closing the loop for blockchain tech.** Crypto/web3 needs primitives which deliver consumer-level utility to close the value loop. I see gaming/content, identity, and special-purpose DeFi being strong contenders, with UGC platforms being a favorite.
- **Neuroscience.** The human brain is my biggest source of fascination, the ultimate scaling factor of civilization. I previously did DBS research at [Gallant Lab](https://gallantlab.org/), and I'll continue as a diligent pupil of the brain over the years to come.
- **US-China.** Cooperation between the two superpowers on issues such as the climate is mission-critical to humanity's existence. I'm concerned about the lack of it.
- **Books.** My biggest hobby outside of "work".

Previously, I've worked at multiple companies in B2B SaaS, AI, and health tech.
