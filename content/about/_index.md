Welcome.

I am an engineer and mathematician by training, an idealistic human by heart. I care deeply about unlocking humanity's best potential using technology.

I am currently building blockchain applications for computational systems. In my view, blockchain is the trustless, interoperable computational substrate that will allow human civilization to correct much of its systemic biases and to expand our civilization thousand-fold.

I am doing brain research in Professor Jack Gallant's lab at UC Berkeley on [an invasive technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation), one with big problems and bigger potential."

Among my side projects, I once built a popular medical information site and raised a small relief fund for Ethiopian children during the first months of covid when things were hard."

Previously, I've worked in the intersections of AI with neurotech, fashion, and health tech.
