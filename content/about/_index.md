## **Yijia Chen**

I'm a founder, engineer, optimist, thinker, and curious human being. I'm currently living in SF and building [Curio](https://www.curio.gg/), a gaming company which allows players to be mechanism creators using smart contracts. I was born and raised in China and studied at UC Berkeley.

Some examples of things I care about:

- **Closing the loop for blockchain tech.** Crypto/web3 needs primitives which deliver consumer-level utility to close the value loop. I see gaming/content, identity, and special-purpose DeFi being strong contenders, with UGC platforms being a favorite.
- **Neuroscience.** The human brain is my biggest source of fascination, the ultimate scaling factor of civilization. I previously did DBS research at [Gallant Lab](https://gallantlab.org/). I see myself as a pupil of the brain over the years to come.
- **US-China.** Cooperation between the two superpowers on issues such as the climate is mission-critical to humanity's existence. I'm concerned about the lack of it.

Previously, I've worked at multiple companies in B2B SaaS, AI, and health tech.
