Things worth being excited about:

- AI
- Energy (fusion, renewables)
- Transportation (rockets, Starship, etc.)
- Biotech & genetics
- Financial market innovation -> potentially crypto-related, think DeFi
- Society-wide incentive system for behavioral change (e.g. encouraging having more kids) -> potentially crypto-related, think StepN
- Neurotech

What do people spend money for? How will they be changed by technological paradigm shifts, aka. opportunities?

- Housing 住: ?? (seems infra-dependent)
- Food 食: 10x from biotech and energy
- Transportation 行: 10x from energy
- Clothing & embellishments 衣: stable
- Education: 10x from AI, stable with human service
- Health: 10x from biotech, stable with human service
- Brain I/O (phone, computer, etc.): stagnant, until 10x from neurotech
- Entertainment (games, movies, music, etc.): stable and growing with human service
- Love and belonging, self-esteem, self-actualization (from Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs): stable and growing with human service
- (Upcoming) Space travel & colonization: uniquely enabled by energy and transportation

P.S.: "衣食住行" is a Chinese phrase that means "clothing, food, housing, and transportation", which are the four basic necessities of life.

P.P.S.: "10x" is obviously not exact, just me saying tremendous disruption and improvement.
