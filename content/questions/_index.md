Some questions I ponder:

- How can the climate crisis be structured to major countries (and maybe billionaires?) in a way that overcomes the [multi-agent trap](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)?
- Is neural networks and large models the end state of AI? If not, what's next?
- The above question for nuclear risk, AI misalignment, and other important existential issues.
- Is it ever feasible to safely write to the brain? Enhance human cognition?
- In the face of [human self-destruction from population collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea), how do we empower more people to start large, secure, and happy families? What are other available solutions from political, economic, social engineering, and biological perspectives?
- What is dark energy? Can intelligence do anything about the eventual "ice death" of the universe?
- Is it possible to set up a stable multiplanetary societal structure, so that non-instantaneous communication does not lead to [Dark Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) hostility?
