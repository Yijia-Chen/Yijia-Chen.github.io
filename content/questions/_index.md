Some questions I ponder:

- How can the climate crisis be structured to major countries (and high-leverage individuals) in a way that overcomes the [multi-agent trap](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)?
- The above question for nuclear risk, AI misalignment, and other important existential issues.
<!-- - How do we restore optimism in people? If formal religions are losing popularity, what supplants them to provide faith and community? -->
- Is neural network the end state of AI? If not, what's the next paradigm?
- Can we ever understand the brain well enough to safely write it? Enhance human cognition?
- In the face of [human self-destruction from population collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_South_Korea), how do we empower more people to start large, secure, and happy families? What are other available tools from political, economic, social engineering, and biological disciplines?
- What is dark energy? Can intelligence do anything about the eventual "ice death" of the universe?
- Is it possible to set up a stable multiplanetary societal structure, so that non-instantaneous communication does not lead to [Dark Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest) hostility?
- Am I asking the right questions?
