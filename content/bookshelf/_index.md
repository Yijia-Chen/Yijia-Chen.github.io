## My favorite books

The list is not comprehensive. For example, in order to be maximally helpful, I've excluded many well-known books which has brought me significant insight, such as Greek philosophy and Homeric literature, many business books, Emerson's essays, many of the most famous modern novels such as Kite Runner, etc. I would definitely recommend them as well.
