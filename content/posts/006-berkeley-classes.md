All of a sudden it's my third year after graduation. Pretty crazy how I graduated at the end of of pre-ChatGPT era.

It's a beautiful Sunday afternoon in Daly City. I decided to review the classes I took during my 3 years at Berkeley and how useful I deem each one to be for what I aim to accomplish now. Turning the tables around, I'll give each class a grade from A+ (the most useful class ever!!) to F (huh? what was this and why on Earth did I take it?). At the end, I'll also comment on the classes I regret for not having taken.

## Fall 2018

### CS 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs): B

Can't complain about this first requirement for a CS major. I remember sitting in a full Zellerbach auditorium as DeNero greeted us with Hello World. Rating it a "B" because I knew a lot of this already from high school and didn't learn too much additional stuff.

### Demography C126 (Sex, Death, and Data): C

Nothing defeats the feeling of a favorite subject being taught at a shallow level. I gained a passion for demography early in middle school and studied population collapse and divergent trends across populations on my own when few paid any attention to it. With all respects for the professor who taught to an uninformed student body, this class was classic "humanities class taught with humanities efficiency". As a result, I spent 1\% of the time I was ready to spend on this topic, got an A, and moved on.

### German 1 (Elementary German 1): A-

I signed up for this class as preparation for my Berlin study-abroad in Summer 2019. Being an international student from China since high school, I've never had a foreign language requirement like what my peers did, despite the extremely low effort some of them put into it. So this was the first time I learned a foreign language "by choice", and it was super exciting. I remember feeling proud when I sounded more German than my German American classmates. Unfortunately, everything was taught in English during my study abroad in Berlin and my German proficiency had rusted since then.

### Math 110 (Linear Algebra): A

One of the most important classes you'll ever take for most STEM stuff later on. I love Sug Woo Shin the professor, who loved what he did and was very patient and sometimes funny. I took this before at CMU during high school so the earlier part was easy for me, but wish I spent more time on the latter part including SVD.

### Natural Resources 24 (Global Environment Theme House Freshman Seminars): B

The required class for environment-themed dorm. It was low-effort and fun to listen to guests such as an ex-chair of US National Parks system.

## Spring 2019

### CS 47B (Data Structures, Self-Completed): B+

An important foundational class for much of computer science stuff after.

### CS 70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory): A

### EE 16B (Designing Information Devices and Systems II): A+

I have a habit of taking a short nap after lunch. EE 16B was right after my only possible lunchtime in a day with very busy schedule, so I often napped through the first 30 minutes of class and struggled to catch up after. I regret that so much as EE 16B was perhaps the highest value class in my entire undergrad education, yet I went in without understanding its importance and came out with zero knowledge.

### Math 104 (Introductino to Analysis): B

### Math H113 (Honors Introduction to Abstract Algebra): A-

Professor Givental was a Soviet professor who was student of Komogorov. He wasn't an easy instructor because of his impatience, difficult accent, and high expectation of students. However, this class was worthwhile precisely because it's clearly a challenge. There were only around 10 of us in this class, all smartest minds in the Math department (except myself). Plus, Abstract Algebra is just so enthrallingâ€”it's like the poetry in mathematics, often requiring great imaginative power. I met a few brilliant minds from the class.
