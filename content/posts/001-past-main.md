This is my past Main page. Now that it's deprecated, I moved it here.

### Blockchain

Humans have pondered how to work together for millions of years, and so far we have [done fairly well](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3010-5) – our complex legal and financial systems evolved to reduce externalities and support collaboration. However, they are deprecating rapidly in the face of enormous societal transformations, either [hardly iterating](https://www.kcrw.com/news/articles/what-is-real-id-and-why-are-dmv-lines-so-long) or [disproportionately benefiting the few](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/10/13/why-and-how-capitalism-needs-to-be-reformed/). Incentive misalignment has once again become a serious hamper on productivity. This is one problem among [many](https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/) that blockchain/web3 can address really well. The noise level in the space is currently overwhelming, but evidence is stacked for a new paradigm’s emergence given long enough time horizon. I’m currently building ZK-related projects involving a fair amount of cryptography and mechanism design – reach out if you’re interested.

### Neuroscience

The human brain is the magical source of all of our decisions -- [some think](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/05/elon-musks-neuralink-bold-ideas-hurdles.html) brain-machine interfaces are humanity's best hope against existential threat from AI, albeit with its [ethical questions](https://www.nature.com/articles/551159a) -- yet currently we know too little about it to develop useful applications. I am doing brain research in Professor Jack Gallant's lab at UC Berkeley on [an invasive technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_brain_stimulation), one with big problems and bigger potential.

In a past life, I once led the backend team of a Series A SaaS company, founded a health tech startup, and also had multiple machine learning and engineering roles. Among my side projects, I once built a popular medical information site and raised a small relief fund for Ethiopian children during the first months of covid when things were hard.
