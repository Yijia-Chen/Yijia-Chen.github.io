*"At times, our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person."* -- Albert Schweitzer

I am deeply grateful for many in my life, many of whose name I cannot even recall, who have transformed me in one way or another. For space's sake, I can only keep a list of those whom I am most grateful for, who often make me feel like the luckiest.
